Questions:


* In the Shining, should the minting of the new asset create only one new asset even if many were supplied to the shining action or should there be one asset per supplied asset?

* Material upgrade within a loop of several assets to shine appears to keep increasing with this:
`material_grade += asset_id - config.genesis_id;`
If you have many assets that could become a large number.
eg. if `genesis_id` = 1 and asset_id starts a 50,51,52,53 the material_grade would become something like 49,100,151,202 etc.
so should this be a cumulative "total" of the material grade for all assets?

* Where is the "packopener" contract on chain?

* In Federation, the `setlandnick` permission of the federation action from Mining doesn't look correctly set.
* Should the `fixstake` action have the permissions set to the `federation@active` or something more specific?
* In Mining, what are the bots all about?
* `receiverand` in the mining expects auth from `ornx.wax` but the permissions on chain are set to `rando` with a key. Should these match?
* the shining account still has a link from the burn to the retire action.
* Should the vesting action in the token contract be linked to a specific auth rather than active (multisig)?
* I'm assuming vesting is the mechanism of transferring tokens between Wax and the Eth contract. Is this correct and is there a secure, automated service offchain that does this transfer?
* There are a few actions in the contracts which look like they were there for debugging only but could cause quite a lot of damage eg. `clearplanets` what's the plan to remove these if any?
