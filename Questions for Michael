Questions:::


# Shining:

1. Material upgrade within a loop of several assets to shine appears to keep increasing with this:
`material_grade += asset_id - config.genesis_id;`
If you have many assets that could become a large number.
Should this be a cumulative "total" of the material grade for all assets?

2. Should the minting of the new asset create only one new asset even if many were supplied to the shining action or should thee be one asset per supplied asset?
(This will also play into the previous question about material grade)

# Mining
3. Can you explain what is the intention of the bots with relation the `setparams` in the mining contract?

4. Where is the "packopener" contract on chain?

5. The `setlandnick` permission of the federation action from Mining doesn't look correctly set.

6. Should the `fixstake` action have the permissions set the `federation@active` or something more specific?
7. What are the bots in the mining all about?
8. `receiverand` in the mining expects auth from `ornx.wax` but the permissions on chain are set to `rando` with a key. Should these match?
9. the shining account still has a link from the burn to the retire action.
10. Should the vesting action in the token contract be linked to a specific auth rather than active (multisig)?
